<h1>Australian Opal Care Instructions</h1>
<p><span>Australian opals are unique and delicate gemstones; approximately 5,000 times rarer than diamonds. Follow the care instructions below to keep yours looking brilliant for many years to come.</span></p>
<h2><span>Know Your Opal Type</span></h2>
<p><span>Before deciding how to best care for your opal, it’s important to understand which type you have:</span></p>
<p><strong>Solid Opal:</strong> Natural solid opal which has only been cut and polished with no additions or enhancements.<br><a data-fancybox="opal-types" href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0947/5447/2258/files/Solid_Opal_Diagram_PNG_800x800px.png?v=1753939094">Click here to view diagram!</a></p>
<p><strong>Doublets:</strong> Made from two layers: a top layer of natural opal and a backing (typically black potch). These layers are bonded with a silicon-based epoxy.<br><a data-fancybox="opal-types" href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0947/5447/2258/files/Doublet_Diagram_PNG_800x800px.png?v=1753939094">Click here to view diagram!</a></p>
<p><strong>Triplets:</strong> Similar to doublets, but with a third clear layer (quartz or glass) placed on top to protect the opal and enhance its dome.<br><a data-fancybox="opal-types" href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0947/5447/2258/files/Triplet_Diagram_PNG_800x800px.png?v=1753939094">Click here to view diagram!</a></p>
<h3>
<span>General Handling</span><span></span>
</h3>
<h4><span>Solid Opal</span></h4>
<ul>
<li><span>Similar to glass, natural opal ranks around 5.5–6.5 on the Mohs hardness scale, making it vulnerable to cracking, chipping, or shattering if dropped or knocked against a hard surface. Always handle your opal with care; especially when set in a ring, which is at higher risk of accidental damage.</span></li>
<li><span>A brief 15 min soak in clean water once a year will help prevent your solid opal from drying out. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4>
<span>Doublets &amp; Triplets</span><span></span>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span class="Apple-converted-space">We </span>use only natural solid Australian black opal potch (opaque opal without play-of-color) as the backing for my doublets. Because of this, our doublets maintain a consistent Mohs hardness ranking throughout the stone. As such, they should be treated with the same level of care as a solid opal.</span><span></span>
</li>
<li><span>Caring for doublets and triplets is slightly different from caring for solid opals. There is a slight risk of layer delamination from repeated and prolonged submersion in water, or exposure to harsh abrasive chemicals.</span></li>
<li>
<span>We offer a lifetime delamination warranty on all of our doublets. If your stone ever begins to separate, contact us and we will gladly repair it for free.</span>
<p><br><span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3> Moisture &amp; Temperature</h3>
<ul>
<li><span>Australian opals contain a high water content and are sensitive to extreme changes in humidity or temperature.</span></li>
<li><span>Sudden environmental shifts can cause the internal water content to expand or contract, potentially weakening the opal’s internal structure and leading to spontaneous cracking.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Cleaning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please do not use ultrasonic or steam cleaners. These can cause the cracking or even shattering of a solid opal and the weakening of the bonding agent in doublets/triplets.</li>
<li>Use a soft, damp cloth and a mild soap if needed.</li>
<li>Do not use or expose your opal to bleach, alcohol, or other abrasive cleaning agents.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Opal Jewelry</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remove all opal jewelry before sleeping, swimming, exercising, or physical labor<br>
</li>
<li>Remove relevant opal jewelry prior to applying lotion, sunscreen, hand sanitizer, oils, or perfume to avoid residue buildup.<br>
</li>
<li>Regularly inspect your opal jewelry to ensure that it is secure in its setting. If the stone is loose within its setting stop wearing it immediately and take it to a jeweler to secure it back into its setting to prevent it from falling out while you are wearing it. </li>
<li>Because opal is a softer gemstone, micro-scratches, scuffs, and dullness caused by regular wear is to be expected. Please email/message me and I will be happy to buff and repolish it back to a vibrant shine for you. If you prefer to have it refinished by someone else, please ensure the person has experience in cutting natural Australian opal, which require a special touch.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Storing Your Opal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Store separately from other gemstones or jewelry to avoid scratches.</li>
<li>A soft-lined box or drawstring pouch is best.<br>
</li>
<li>Ideal environmental conditions are 50%-60% humidity and 65-75<span>°F / 18-24</span><span>°C</span>
</li>
<li>For long-term storage - wrap it in a clean piece of cotton or wool with a few drops of water, and place it in a sealed bag to maintain a consistent humidity level.</li>
</ul>
